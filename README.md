# ffmpeg-static

**[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) static binaries for Mac OSX, Linux, Windows.**

Supports macOS (64-bit and arm64), Linux (32 and 64-bit, armhf, arm64), Windows (32 and 64-bit). [The ffmpeg version currently used is `5.0`.](https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static/releases/tag/b5.0)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ffmpeg-static.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static)
![minimum Node.js version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/ffmpeg-static.svg)

*Note:* The version of `ffmpeg-static` follows [SemVer](http://semver.org). When releasing new versions, **we do *not* consider breaking changes in `ffmpeg` itself**, but only the JS interface (see below). For example, `ffmpeg-static@4.5.0` downloads ffmpeg `5.0`. To prevent an `ffmpeg-static` upgrade downloading backwards-incompatible ffmpeg versions, [use a strict version range](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies) for it or use a [lockfile](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json).

Also check out [`node-ffmpeg-installer`](https://github.com/kribblo/node-ffmpeg-installer)!

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install ffmpeg-static
```

*Note:* During installation, it will download the appropriate `ffmpeg` binary from the [`b5.0` GitHub release](https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static/releases/tag/b5.0). Use and distribution of the binary releases of FFmpeg are covered by their respective license.

### Electron & other cross-platform packaging tools

Because `ffmpeg-static` will download a binary specific to the OS/platform, you need to purge `node_modules` before (re-)packaging your app *for a different OS/platform* ([read more in #35](https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static/issues/35#issuecomment-630225392)).

## Example Usage

Returns the path of a statically linked ffmpeg binary on the local filesystem.

``` js
import pathToFfmpeg from 'ffmpeg-static';
console.log(pathToFfmpeg);
```

```
/Users/j/playground/node_modules/ffmpeg-static/ffmpeg
```

Check the [example script](example.js) for a more thorough example.

## Sources of the binaries

[The build script](build/index.sh) downloads binaries from these locations:

- [Windows x64 builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
- [Windows x86 builds](https://github.com/sudo-nautilus/FFmpeg-Builds-Win32/)
- [Linux x64/x86/ARM/ARM64 builds](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/)
- macOS [x64 (Intel)](https://evermeet.cx/pub/ffmpeg/) & [ARM64 (Apple Silicon)](https://osxexperts.net/) builds

The build script extracts build information and (when possible) the license file from the downloaded package or the distribution server. Please consult the individual build's project site for exact source versions, which you can locate based on the version information included in the README file.

## Show your support

This npm package includes statically linked binaries that are produced by the following individuals. Please consider supporting and donating to them who have been providing quality binary builds for many years:

- **Linux builds**: [John Van Sickle](https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/)
- **macOS builds**: [Helmut K. C. Tessarek](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/#donations)

## Building the project

The `unzip`, `tar` CLI executables need to be installed. On macOS, use `brew install gnu-tar xz`.
