# ffmpeg-static

**[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) static binaries for Mac OSX and Linux and Windows.**

Supports macOS (64-bit), Linux (32 and 64-bit, armhf, arm64) and Windows (32 and 64-bit). The current ffmpeg version is `4.2.1`.

*Note:* The version of `ffmpeg-static` follows [SemVer](http://semver.org). When releasing new versions, **we do *not* consider breaking changes in `ffmpeg` itself**, but only the JS interface (see below). To stop `ffmpeg-static` from breaking your code by getting updated, [lock the version down](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies) or use a [lockfile](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json).
